# 🥗 NutriPal – AI-Based Healthy Recipe Generator

NutriPal is a smart recipe suggestion tool that helps users discover healthy meals using the ingredients they already have. It’s built to support quick, clean eating with diet filters like vegan, high-protein, and gluten-free — making personalized food choices easier.


## 💡 Project Overview

This project uses rule-based logic to match user-provided ingredients with recipes from a predefined dataset. The goal is to reduce food waste and promote healthy eating habits using simple AI principles.
